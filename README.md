# LunarByte-Showcase
A showcase of games and code I did when I was working at LunarByte

##Block Way
A hyper casual mobile (Android/iOS) game in which you control a saw blade and try to cut down as many blocks as you can while dodging rocks.

##Fenced
A puzzle game (Android/iOS) in which you draw a route to help an animal get out of a maze.
